# SecurityPro
This is similar to a rogues of the 2000s and 2010s.

File Structure 'FunctionsDisabler' 'Installer' 'SecurityPro'

'FunctionsDisabler' - Uses the Registry to disable Task Manager, Command Prompt, User Account Control, Registry Editor, etc which can incapacitate some apps, such as a browser or any exe you would want (apart from Windows Defender executables, so i guess Microsoft thought it out lol)  - Finished

'Installer' - Downloads the files, runs one exe (the FunctionsDisabler), then set the Rogue as a Startup Executable and reboot. - Almost Finished

'SecurityPro' The Rogue - Nowhere near finished.

# todo
Setup a Fake 'Emergency Mode' for Browsers, however for now it is referencing the Rogue

Finish the Rogue (currently just looks at md5 hashes, and has a basic history function)

I may try mimc the 'fake scanners' which would have a believable explorer scanner and have a fake scanner saying you had many viruses, and then ask you to download ther scanner

# other
I am new to coding (and i did kinda use a LLM to help me out, but most of the code is myne).
If someone has more experience with C# and is willing to help please do so, i'd immensily appreciate it.
